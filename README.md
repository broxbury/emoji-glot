The application supports 8 different languages, and 9 emojis which each have a list of common expressions associated with the emotion or sentiment that emoji represents.

## Project Details:
EMOJI-GLOT was created using REACT, and utilizes functional components and React hooks. There is an extensive testing suite build using Jest as a test runner and React Testing Library. EMOJI-GLOT is powered by the Microsoft Text Translation API, and can be easily updated to support any language that is currently supported by the API. 

## Features

If a user wishes to save a translation, the language, original expression/phrase, and the translation will be saved in local storage for later use and review. 

## Future Improvements / ToDo's 
Looking ahead, support for audio translations would be a great extention for those language learners hoping to practice their speaking ability!
